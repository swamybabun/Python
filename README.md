Python
Python is high level programming language. Python is most wanted and widely used language now a days in every domians. Its good to learn such a cool language. I hope you wil enjoy learning Python.

Let's begin the show..!

# Data types

1) **int**    -> Data type to store integer values
2) **float**  -> Data type to store floating point numbers
3) **str**    -> Data type to store text values

- Creating and initialising different data type variables

    age=20
    salary =20345
    pi=3.4
    name ="test name"
    firstname ='initial name'

- To know the type of variable, you can user type() function.Few examples.

    type(age) => int
    type(salary)        => int
    type(pi)            => float
    type(name)          => str
    type(firstname)     => str

- Operators

Addition  :   => Useful for calculating the addition of a number with another.

    1 + 4 gives 5

    1.4 + 5.9 gives 7.3

"firstname" + "lastname" => firstnamelastname

Subtraction  : -  => Useful for calculating the subtraccting a number from another.

    1 - 4 gives -3

    5.9 - 4.3 gives 1.6

"firstname" - "lastname" => gives you error as "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'"

Multiplication  : * => Useful for calculating the multipling a number with another.

    1 * 2 => 2

Factorial : **  =>  Useful for calculating the factorial of a number

    2 ** 3 ==> 2 * 2 * 2 => 8
